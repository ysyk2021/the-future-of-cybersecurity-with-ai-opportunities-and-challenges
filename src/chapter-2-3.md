AI has become an essential tool in the field of cybersecurity. In this chapter, we will explore tools and software that enable AI-enabled cyber planning and performance tracking.

AI-Enabled Cyber Planning
-------------------------

AI can be used to develop comprehensive cybersecurity strategies and plans. By analyzing large volumes of data, AI can help organizations identify potential risks and vulnerabilities and develop proactive measures to prevent cyber attacks.

AI-Enabled Performance Tracking
-------------------------------

AI can also be used to track the effectiveness of cybersecurity programs. By monitoring key performance metrics such as incident response time, AI can help organizations evaluate the effectiveness of their cybersecurity programs and make adjustments as needed.

Threat Intelligence Platforms
-----------------------------

Threat intelligence platforms are software tools that use AI to analyze large volumes of data and identify potential cyber threats. These platforms can provide real-time alerts and recommendations to help organizations respond more quickly and effectively to cyber attacks.

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools
------------------------------------------------------

SIEM tools are software tools that use AI to monitor network activity and identify potential security incidents. These tools can help organizations detect and respond to potential cyber threats in real-time.

Incident Response Platforms
---------------------------

Incident response platforms are software tools that use AI to automate the incident response process. By providing real-time alerts and automated responses, these platforms can help organizations respond more quickly and efficiently to cyber attacks.

Conclusion
----------

Tools and software that enable AI-enabled cyber planning and performance tracking are essential for effective cybersecurity. By leveraging these tools, organizations can better detect and respond to potential cyber threats, protect their sensitive information, and prevent cyber attacks. By following best practices and prioritizing transparency, accountability, and diversity and inclusion principles, organizations can ensure that AI technology is used effectively in cybersecurity.
